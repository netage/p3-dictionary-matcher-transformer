			+ "modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton "
			+ "and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles. It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit "
			+ "assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the "
			+ "Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016. The ownership and use of the space station is established "
			+ "in intergovernmental treaties and agreements which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to "
			+ "retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment "
			+ "allocated between the other international partners.";
